PROJECT OUTLINE

As a freelance Machine Learning Engineer, I contributed to a project for a manufacturing company specializing in producing metal parts for diverse industries. The company had been exploring a novel metal alloy with purportedly superior properties compared to their current one. However, practical implementation revealed the alloy's sensitivity to variations in processing parameters, leading to the formation of defects. If these defects exceeded a certain size, they significantly compromised the lifespan of the metal parts, necessitating the scrapping of the entire part as defective.

To address this challenge, the company sought a Machine Learning solution capable of estimating the lifespan of a part based on easily recorded parameters, aiming to streamline and enhance their production process. Additionally, there was a secondary objective to develop a Machine Learning solution for the automatic classification of parts as defective or non-defective using provided scans, as the current manual classification process was labor-intensive.
The company has collected two sets of data:
1. A table of processing parameters and measurements taken from the 
completed parts.
2. A collection of images from scanning the surface of the completed parts.


Key Achievements
1. Successfully developed and deployed a machine learning model for estimating the lifespan of metal parts, enabling the company to predict potential defects early in the production process.
2. Implemented a defect classification model that automates the identification of defective parts, streamlining the quality control process.
3. Provided actionable insights for process optimization based on the interpretation of model outputs.
