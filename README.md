# Metal_Company
PROJECT OUTLINE

You are working as a Data Scientist for a (fictitious) manufacturing company who
makes metal parts for various industries. They have been experimenting with a new 
metal alloy that should have superior properties to the one they are currently using;
however, in practice they have been finding it is very sensitive to changes in the 
processing parameters causing defects to form. If these defects reach a certain size, 
they severely impact the lifespan of the metal parts, meaning the entire part must be 
scrapped as defective.
However, the process of measuring a parts lifespan is a slow, destructive, and 
expensive process, so the company are hoping you can create a Machine Learning 
solution that allows them to estimate the lifespan of a part based on the more easily 
recorded parameters, which the company hopes to use to refine their production 
process. A secondary objective for the company is for you to create a Machine 
Learning solution that can use the provided scans to automatically classify whether a 
part is defective or not, as they are currently having to do this manually.
The company has collected two sets of data:
1. A table of processing parameters and measurements taken from the 
completed parts.
2. A collection of images from scanning the surface of the completed parts.
